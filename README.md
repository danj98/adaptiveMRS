# Adaptive Multi-Robot Mission Planning
This repository contains the project for my master's thesis in software engineering. The software focuses on enabling adaptability in dynamic situations for multi-robot mission based on model-driven engineering.

## How To Run
The software is currently set up to test different task allocation algorithms against each other as well as train the Q-learning algorithm. The entry point for the software can be found in the Main.kt file.
